See [A New Look Leads to a New Blogging System](http://www.windley.com/archives/2013/04/a_new_look_leads_to_a_new_blogging_system.shtml) for information about this blogging system. 

This system depends on files in a specific directory hierarchy and with specific meta data in the HTML comments. The [elisp file I use for blogging](https://github.com/windley/emacs/blob/master/blogging.el) is specifically designed to create files with the correct format in the right directory hierarchy.
